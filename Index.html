Education not only nourishes your child but also acts as a fundamental method of social progress and reform. We strive to equip our children with all the four E’s: Education, Experience, Ethical strength and Emotional sustenance.

The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life. As each child is unique, we focus on how to help them bring out their best.

Studies have shown that our brains remain strongly influenced by our environmental conditions. The greatest impact to a child’s IQ is during his infancy stage, especially till the age of 8 or 9 years.The baby’s intelligence is not fully developed at birth but gradually evolves and changes, especially throughout the early elementary school years.

Children are like soft clay and just like moulding a pot, you can shape the child’s potential when the clay is soft and wet i.e. during his initial days at school. Sustained encouragement and positive reinforcement through dedicated coaching and perseverance can shape your child to be successful. We need to be careful about what we say and do because negative actions and words could affect them in a negative way. Once the clay is dry, it is impossible to change its shape and hence we need to teach them in a proper way right from a very early age.
